# X-Ray_Chest_Diagnostic
The aim of this task is to diagnose the chest x rays for three cases : normal, covid and virus. The classes are almost balanced and the number of images is so small with different shapes, so it is good idea to use Transfer Learning 🫁🩺.

1 - covid : 294, normal : 468 , virus : 433 cases .
2 - Using Resizing for Different shapes as grayscale, rgb, ...etc. 
3 - Normalizing the images.
4 - Using custom model.
5 - Using pretrained model.
